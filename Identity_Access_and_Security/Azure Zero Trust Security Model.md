## 🛡 Azure Zero Trust Security Model — AZ-900

**Zero Trust** is a security approach that assumes no user, device, or network is automatically trusted — even inside the corporate network.<br>

Every access request must be verified as if it came from an untrusted environment.<br>

---

## 🔐 Core Idea

👉 Never trust by default<br>
👉 Always verify explicitly<br>

---

📌 Exam Line:<br>
Zero Trust assumes breach and verifies every request.<br>

---

## 🎯 Why Zero Trust Is Needed Today

• Cloud environments are distributed<br>
• Remote work is common<br>
• Devices connect from everywhere<br>
• Traditional network perimeter is gone<br>
• Data lives in multiple locations<br>

## 📜 Three Guiding Principles (VERY IMPORTANT)

---

### ✅ Verify Explicitly

• Authenticate every user and device<br>
• Use all available signals (location, device, risk, identity)<br>
• No implicit trust<br>

---

### 🔐 Use Least Privilege Access

• Grant minimum required permissions<br>
• Just-In-Time (JIT) access<br>
• Just-Enough-Access (JEA)<br>
• Risk-based access controls<br>

---

### 🚨 Assume Breach

• Act as if attackers are already inside<br>
• Limit access spread (segmentation)<br>
• Encrypt everything end-to-end<br>
• Monitor continuously<br>
• Detect and respond quickly<br>

---

## 🔄 Traditional Security vs Zero Trust

**Traditional Model:**<br>
• Trust users inside network<br>
• Focus on perimeter security<br>

**Zero Trust Model:**<br>
• Trust no one automatically<br>
• Verify every access request<br>
• Security based on identity & context<br>

---

## 🧠 AZ-900 Exam Keywords

• Never trust, always verify<br>
• Assume breach mindset<br>
• Identity-based security<br>
• Least privilege access<br>
• Continuous verification<br>

---

## 📒 Quick Notebook Summary

> The Zero Trust security model assumes that every access request may be a threat and requires explicit verification regardless of location. It follows three principles: verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach to minimize risk and improve security.

### 🎯 Easy Memory Trick

Zero Trust = no automatic trust<br>
Always authenticate + minimal access + assume hackers exist<br>
