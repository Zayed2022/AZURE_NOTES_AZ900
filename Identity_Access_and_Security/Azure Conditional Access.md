## 🛡 Azure Conditional Access — AZ-900

**Conditional Access** is a Microsoft Entra ID security feature that controls access to resources based on identity signals such as user, location, device, and application.<br>

---

## 📡 Identity Signals Used

• Who the user is (role, account type)<br>
• Where the user is (location, IP address)<br>
• What device is used (managed, compliant, unknown)<br>
• What application is being accessed<br>

---

## 🔄 How Conditional Access Works (Exam Flow)

**Signal → Decision → Enforcement**<br>

### 📥 Signal

Collect user context:<br>
• Location<br>
• Device<br>
• Risk level<br>
• App being accessed<br>

---

### 🧠 Decision

• Allow access<br>
• Block access<br>
• Require MFA<br>
• Require managed device<br>

---

### 🚦 Enforcement

• Grant access<br>
• Deny access<br>
• Challenge with MFA<br>

---

📌 Exam Line:<br>
Conditional Access = if this, then that security policy.<br>

---

## 🔐 Key Benefits

• Protects organizational resources<br>
• Reduces unauthorized access<br>
• Applies security only when needed<br>
• Improves user productivity safely<br>

---

## 📍 Common Use Cases (EXAM FAVORITE)

• Require MFA for admins<br>
• Require MFA when outside company network<br>
• Block logins from risky countries<br>
• Allow access only from compliant devices<br>
• Restrict which apps can access services<br>

---

## 🧠 AZ-900 Exam Keywords

• Identity-based access control<br>
• Location-aware security<br>
• Device-based access rules<br>
• Risk-based MFA enforcement<br>
• Signal → decision → enforcement model<br>

---

## 📒 Quick Notebook Summary

> Azure Conditional Access uses identity signals like user, location, device, and application to control access to resources. It enables security policies such as requiring MFA, blocking risky sign-ins, and allowing access only from trusted devices or locations.

---

### 🎯 Easy Memory Trick

Conditional Access = smart security rules<br>
Risky login → MFA or block<br>
Trusted login → seamless access<br>
