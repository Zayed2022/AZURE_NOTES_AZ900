## 🔁 Reliability & Predictability in the Cloud (AZ-900)

Reliability and predictability help build cloud solutions that are resilient, stable, and cost-effective.<br>

---

## ✅ Reliability

**Definition:**
Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue operating without major disruption.<br>

---

### ☁ Why Cloud is Reliable

• Cloud uses decentralized global infrastructure<br>
• Resources can run across multiple regions<br>
• If one region fails, another can continue operations<br>
• Supports disaster recovery and fault tolerance<br>
• Some services automatically fail over to healthy regions<br>

---

### 🔁 AWS Mapping

Azure global regions ↔ AWS global regions<br>
Azure failover ↔ AWS disaster recovery / multi-region setup<br>

---

### 📌 Exam Points

• Reliability focuses on recovery from failures<br>
• Enabled by multi-region deployment<br>
• Improves resilience and uptime<br>

---

## 📊 Predictability

Predictability helps control both **performance** and **cost** in cloud environments.<br>

---

### ⚡ Performance Predictability

• Ensures applications perform consistently under varying loads<br>
• Uses autoscaling to handle traffic spikes<br>
• Load balancing distributes traffic evenly<br>
• High availability prevents performance drops during failures<br>

---

**AWS Mapping:**<br>
Auto Scaling + ELB ↔ Azure Autoscale + Load Balancer<br>

---

### 💰 Cost Predictability

• Track resource usage in real time<br>
• Forecast cloud spending<br>
• Adjust resources to optimize cost<br>
• Use cost estimation tools before deployment<br>

Azure tools:<br>
• Pricing Calculator<br>
• TCO Calculator<br>

**AWS Equivalent:**<br>
AWS Pricing Calculator + Cost Explorer<br>

---

## 🧠 AZ-900 Exam Keywords

• Reliability = resilience & recovery<br>
• Predictability = performance + cost control<br>
• Multi-region deployment<br>
• Autoscaling & load balancing<br>
• Cost forecasting tools<br>

---

## 📒 Quick Notebook Summary

> Reliability ensures cloud systems recover from failures using global infrastructure and redundancy. Predictability enables consistent performance through autoscaling and load balancing and helps forecast and manage cloud costs using monitoring and pricing tools.
