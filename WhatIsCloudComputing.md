## 🚀 Why Cloud is Powerful (Important for AZ-900)

### ✔ No Physical Datacenter Needed

You don’t buy servers.

AWS → no on-prem EC2
Azure → no physical VM hardware

---

### ✔ Fast Scaling (Very Exam Important)

If traffic increases:

AWS → launch more EC2
Azure → scale more VMs instantly

📌 This is called **Scalability & Elasticity**

## 🧠 Key AZ-900 Exam Words (Remember These)

Microsoft loves these terms:

✅ On-demand resources
✅ Delivered over internet
✅ No physical infrastructure
✅ Rapid scaling
✅ Pay only for what you use

# 📒 Ultra-Short Note 

> Cloud computing delivers servers, storage, databases, networking, AI, ML, and IoT over the internet instead of physical data centers. It allows rapid scaling without building infrastructure.

---

### 🎯 In AWS language:

> Cloud = using EC2, S3, RDS over internet instead of buying servers.
