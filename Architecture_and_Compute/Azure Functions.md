## ⚡ Azure Functions — Serverless Compute (AZ-900)

**Definition:**
Azure Functions is an event-driven, serverless compute service that runs code in response to events without managing servers, virtual machines, or containers.<br>

---

## ☁ What “Serverless” Means

• No infrastructure management required<br>
• No need to keep servers running<br>
• Code runs only when triggered<br>
• Azure automatically allocates and deallocates resources<br>

---

### 🔁 AWS Mapping

Azure Functions ↔ AWS Lambda<br>

(Same serverless concept)<br>

---

## 🚀 Key Benefits of Azure Functions

• Runs only when events occur<br>
• Automatically scales based on demand<br>
• Pay only for execution time (CPU usage)<br>
• No VM or container maintenance<br>
• Ideal for short-lived tasks<br>

---

## ⚙ Common Triggers (Exam Examples)

• HTTP requests (REST APIs)<br>
• Timers (scheduled jobs)<br>
• Messages from Azure services (queues, events)<br>
• File uploads or data changes<br>

---

## 📊 Stateless vs Stateful Functions

**Stateless (default):**<br>
• No memory of previous runs<br>
• Starts fresh each time<br>

**Stateful (Durable Functions):**<br>
• Maintains context across executions<br>
• Tracks workflow steps<br>

---

## 📦 When to Use Azure Functions

• Event-driven workloads<br>
• Automation tasks<br>
• Microservices<br>
• Real-time data processing<br>
• APIs without servers<br>

---

## 🧠 AZ-900 Exam Keywords

• Serverless compute<br>
• Event-driven execution<br>
• Automatic scaling<br>
• Pay per execution<br>
• No infrastructure management<br>
• Durable Functions (stateful)<br>

## 📒 Quick Notebook Summary

> Azure Functions is a serverless, event-driven compute service that runs code only when triggered. It scales automatically, requires no server management, and charges only for execution time, making it ideal for short and variable workloads.

### 🎯 AWS Memory Shortcut

Azure Functions = AWS Lambda<br>
Serverless = no servers to manage<br>
Trigger = event wakes function<br>
Pay = only when code runs<br>
