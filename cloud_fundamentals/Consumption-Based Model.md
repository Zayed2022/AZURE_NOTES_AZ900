## 💰 Consumption-Based Model (AZ-900)

**Definition:**
Cloud computing follows a consumption-based (pay-as-you-go) model where you pay only for the resources you use, not for physical infrastructure.<br>

---

### 📦 Capital Expenditure (CapEx)

• One-time upfront cost for physical infrastructure<br>
• Buying servers, datacenter buildings, networking equipment<br>
• Requires long-term planning and large investment<br>

**AWS/Azure Context:**<br>
Traditional on-prem datacenter costs<br>

**Exam Point:**<br>
CapEx = upfront hardware investment<br>

---

### 🔄 Operational Expenditure (OpEx)

• Ongoing spending based on usage over time<br>
• Paying monthly for services you consume<br>
• No physical infrastructure ownership<br>

**AWS/Azure Context:**<br>
Paying for EC2/VMs, S3/Blob Storage per usage<br>

**Exam Point:**<br>
Cloud operates on OpEx model<br>

## ☁ Why Cloud Uses Consumption-Based Pricing

• No upfront infrastructure cost<br>
• Pay only for what you use<br>
• Scale up resources when demand increases<br>
• Scale down and stop paying when demand decreases<br>
• No wasted capacity<br>

---

### 📉 Traditional Datacenter Problems

• Must predict future capacity in advance<br>
• Overestimate → wasted money<br>
• Underestimate → performance issues<br>
• Hardware upgrades take time (buy, install, power, cooling)<br>

---

### 🚀 Cloud Advantage

• Instantly add resources when needed<br>
• Remove resources when not needed<br>
• Billed only for active usage<br>
• Cloud provider manages hardware & infrastructure<br>

---

## 🔁 AWS Mapping (Same Model)

• AWS EC2 billed per second/minute → Azure VM billed per usage<br>
• AWS S3 storage pay per GB → Azure Blob Storage pay per GB<br>

📌 Same consumption-based pricing in both AWS & Azure<br>

## 🧠 AZ-900 Exam Keywords

• Pay-as-you-go<br>
• OpEx model<br>
• No upfront cost<br>
• Elastic scaling<br>
• Pay only for consumed resources<br>

---

## 📒 Quick Notebook Summary

> Cloud computing uses a consumption-based pricing model under OpEx where customers pay only for resources they use. It eliminates upfront infrastructure costs and allows scaling resources up or down based on demand.

### 🎯 AWS Shortcut Memory

On-prem = CapEx (buy servers)<br>
Cloud = OpEx (rent servers)<br>
Use more → pay more<br>
Use less → pay less<br>
